## 🎥 Based on: Onshape Tutorial

This model was created while following the tutorial from YouTube:

**🔗 [Create a Simple Model in Onshape (Beginner Friendly)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utLjjkXpIg)**  
by CAD Class

The video guides through the creation of a basic parametric part in Onshape using:
- **Sketching**
- **Extrude**
- **Revolve**
- **Fillet and Chamfer**

The project served as a **practical introduction to parametric 3D modeling** and is a part of my self-paced learning path in CAD for production engineering.

I slightly modified the geometry to explore custom dimensions and constraints.
