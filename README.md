## 🎥 Based on: Onshape Tutorial

This 3D model was created while following the YouTube tutorial:

🎬 **[Create a Simple Model in Onshape (Beginner Friendly)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utLjjkXpIg)**  
by **CAD Class**

The tutorial walks through the step-by-step process of designing a basic parametric component using:

- ✏️ **Sketching**
- 🧱 **Extrude**
- 🔄 **Revolve**
- ✨ **Fillet and Chamfer**

## 🎓 Learning Purpose

This project served as a **practical introduction to parametric 3D modeling** in Onshape and is part of my **self-paced learning path in CAD for production engineering**.

🔧 I also made small customizations to the geometry to explore:
- constraint-based design
- dimension editing
- feature history modification

[🔗 Open in Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/bf4776db889388ca528cdd6c/w/ffde85486e46288e3e23c31f/e/f157efd75025dfac949d53ae)

🎬 Based on the CAD challenge by **TooTallToby**:  
**[What is the MASS of this part? | Gate Hinge Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJHViLPJNuw&t=33s)**

This part was modeled from a full 2D technical drawing, with the goal of calculating an accurate mass.

🧮 **Material:** Aluminum 1060  
📐 **Density:** 2700 kg/m³  
⚖️ **Mass result:** 1314.824 g ± 2 g (within ±1 g tolerance)

This exercise helped me practice:
- interpreting mechanical drawings
- modeling with precision and tolerances
- using mass properties tools in Onshape
